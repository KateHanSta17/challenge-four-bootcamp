# 04 Web APIs: Personal Blog

## Your Task

In this challenge, you'll create a two-page website where users will input and view blog posts. It includes building a content form, dynamically rendering blog posts, and implementing a light/dark mode toggle. As you code, you'll gain practical JavaScript experience, explore the Document Object Model's power, and set the stage for more advanced tasks.

## User Story

```md
AS A marketing student,
I WANT a personal blog
SO THAT I can showcase my thoughts and experiences.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a personal blog
WHEN I load the app,
THEN I am presented with the landing page containing a form with labels and inputs for username, blog title, and blog content.
WHEN I try to submit a form without a username, title, or content,
THEN I am presented with a message that prompts me to complete the form.
WHEN I submit the form,
THEN blog post data is stored to localStorage.
WHEN the form submits,
THEN I am redirected to the posts page.
WHEN I view the posts page,
THEN I am presented with a header, with a light mode/dark mode toggle, and a "Back" button.
WHEN I click the light mode/dark mode toggle,
THEN the page content's styles update to reflect the selection.
WHEN I click the "Back" button,
THEN I am redirected back to the landing page where I can input more blog entries.
WHEN I view the main content,
THEN I am presented with a list of blog posts that are pulled from localStorage.
WHEN I view localStorage,
THEN I am presented with a JSON array of blog post objects, each including the post author's username, title of the post, and post's content.
WHEN I take a closer look at a single blog entry in the list,
THEN I can see the title, the content, and the author of the post.
```

## Grading Requirements

This Challenge is graded based on the following criteria:

### Landing Page 35%

The landing page should contain the following HTML (5 pts):

* A `form` element that contains the following:

  * An `input` element whose label and id are `username`.

  * An `input` element whose label and id are `title`.

  * A `textarea` element whose label and id are `content`.

The form must use the following logic:

* Display the error message `"Please complete the form."` when the form is submitted with empty fields. (10 pts)

* Store form data in local storage when submitted with valid data. (10 pts)

  * Blog post objects in local storage must contain `username`, `title`, and `content` properties. (5 pts)

* Redirect to the blog page when valid data is submitted. (5 pts)

### Blog Page HTML 10%

The blog page must contain the following HTML:

* A `header` element that contains (5 pts):

  * A light mode/dark mode toggle. The toggle element can be anything you like, but the id must be `toggle`.

  * A "Back" button with an id of `back`.

* A `main` element. (5 pts)

### Toggle Logic 20%

When the light mode/dark mode toggle is clicked:

* The styles of the page change to match the mode. (10 pts)

* The `--circle-color` attribute changes to match the mode. (10 pts)

### Blog Post Logic 35%

The Blog Post page must perform the following:

* Render blog posts to the page with data pulled from `localStorage`. (10 pts)

  * Rendered blog posts must include the author's `username`, and the post's `title` and `content`. (10 pts)

  * If no blog posts are found in `localStorage`, display a message that states: `"No Blog posts yet..."`. (10 pts)
